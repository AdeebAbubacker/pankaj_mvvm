Dr. Pankaj Educational Trust App
Welcome to the Dr. Pankaj Educational Trust App, designed to streamline the process of selecting and supporting meritorious yet financially challenged students for higher education.

Dr. Pankaj Educational and Charitable Trust, established by Dr. Thampil Pankaj, a renowned economist formerly associated with prestigious organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank, aims to empower deserving students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Kerala, India.

About the Trust
Founded in 1999, the trust primarily operates in Ernakulam District, Dr. Pankaj's hometown, and the neighboring Idukki District, which faces higher levels of poverty. Annually, the trust selects approximately 15-20 students (with flexibility depending on available funds) from 16 high schools. Selection criteria are based on both academic excellence and financial need, with a balanced 50-50 weighting. Selected students receive financial assistance to complete their degree courses, typically spanning 3 to 4 years. Presently, around 50 students benefit from these scholarships, with 70% of the funding derived from the interest earned on Dr. Pankaj's initial endowment, supplemented by donations from family and friends.
